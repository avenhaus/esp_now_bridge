# ESP-NOW to Serial Bridge

Receive (encrypted) ESP-NOW messages and convert them to JSON on the serial port. These can be processed by a Home Assistant Custom Component

This allows to create battery powered ESP32 sensor nodes for Home Assistant.

EspHome is great, but it only works with WIFI which is not suitable for long term battery operation.
